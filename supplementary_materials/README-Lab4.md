# Overview

This lab will cover 3D transformation with several interaction methods.

There is a basic scene configuration, and your main responsibility is to

1. render a sphere and cube;
2. give them unique transforms with keyboard/mouse inputs.

You will edit `modules/labs/lab4.js` and `modules/cs380/primitives.js` in this lab.
Fill in the section commented with `TODO:` and write your own helper functions if necessary.

For more information, refer to the lab session slides on KLMS.
