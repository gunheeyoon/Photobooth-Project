# Overview

This lab covers any topics of non-photorealistic rendering.

Your main responsibility is to

1. Design a scene to show your creativity.
2. Implement at least one NPR technique, and render the scene.
3. Take at least two screenshots of the scene with different view, or different parameter settings.
4. Briefly explain for which usages your implementation can be applied.

You will edit `modules/labs/lab7.js`, `modules/toon.js`, and `resources/toon.frag` in this lab. Fill in the section commented with `TODO:` and write your own helper functions if necessary.
