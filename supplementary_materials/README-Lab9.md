# Overview

This lab will cover 'Render to Texture'

There is a basic scene configuration, and your main responsibility is to

1. Render a scene to a texture
2. Apply edge detection to the texture
3. Render scene and pip of texture together

You will edit `modules/labs/lab9.js`, `resources/effect_edge.frag` in this lab.
Fill in the section commented with `TODO:` and write your own helper functions if necessary.

For more information, refer to the lab session slides on KLMS.
