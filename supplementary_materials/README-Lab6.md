# Overview

This lab covers importing 3D objects, and  Blinn-Phong reflection model supporting directional light source.

Your main responsibility is to

1. Import at least one wavefront format 3D object (*.obj), and render it in `modules/labs/lab6.js`. 
2. Implement ambient and diffuse reflections for directional light source in `resources/blinn_phong.frag` 
    - You may refer `resources/simple.frag`.
3. Implement specular reflection for directional light source in `resources/blinn_phong.frag`.

You will edit `modules/labs/lab6.js` and `resources/simple.frag` in this lab. Fill in the section commented with `TODO:` and write your own helper functions if necessary.

For more information, refer to the lab session slides on KLMS.

# Specifications and Points

Make your own rendering result by changing lighting parameters (ambient/diffuse/specular coefficients, and shininess) and submit one **screenshot** of your final scene that ambient, diffuse, and specular reflections are well recognized.
