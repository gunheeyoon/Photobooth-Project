# Overview

In this lab, you will create a 2D animation of a complex shape.
Your responsibility in this lab is to animate a star-shaped object to spin and orbit at the same time.
You only need to edit `modules/labs/lab2.js` file in this lab.
Fill in the section commented with `TODO:` and write your own helper functions if necessary.

For more information, refer to the lab session slides on KLMS.
